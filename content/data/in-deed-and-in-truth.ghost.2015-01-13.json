It was in the middle of some hard weeks at our house. I have to go back a few weeks before that, to the longest winter I have EVER known. I can tell you it's been hard. Even New Jersey guys are saying this year was hard. So, it's not just this southern girl. Everybody was ready for April. So, our family makes it through the winter without any major sickness. Then here comes April right around the corner and we could feel the tension building as we were able to actually get outside and play since oh, October? without being cold and miserable.\r\n\r\nThree out of four kids come down with the stomach bug at the end of March. Then as we are getting somewhat back into routine, some family came to visit and from that visit we end up w/ our youngest in the ER with bad croup, having breathing treatments and the youngest 3 with 103 fevers. As that week closes and we are trying to recover from lots of holding and watching movies, which means nothing got \"done\" around the house which may or may not have gotten accomplished without sickness! We then have a weekend of catch up on laundry and some cleaning and try to get prepared for a new week. Then that Monday night our oldest complains of stomach pains, where her appendix is located. I then spend all night watching her while she tries to rest, only to go the Dr and confirm what I already knew; appendicitis. So, we head to the ER, just one week after being in the ER with our youngest, to confirm with machines that indeed it is appendicitis. After an emergency appendectomy and a week of her watching movies, helping her walk everywhere and normal mealtimes and play times with the other kids,  I was ready for a quiet weekend. So, we headed into another week when our sweet 10 year old German Sheppard started acting weird. She started limping and not eating. We then start another week and I'm taking care of a dieing dog, and 4 kids who are now ready to get outside and play because the weather is beautiful! We ended up having to put our dog down. I can't stop to think about it too long, because it's still sad. I miss her already. She had been with us almost our whole marriage. She welcomed home 4 out of 5 kids and moved across the country with us! She was kinda like a \"nana\" dog from Peter Pan. Always checking on the kids and was always there at the end of long days to sit by me. She comforted me in some of my darkest days and for that I'm grateful. I was never an indoor dog person until I met my husband and over the years I've come to appreciate it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo, after 6 weeks of crazy later I'm emotionally and physically drained. I'm now looking at the end of another weekend and looking into the beginning of a new week and month with hope that only comes from the Lord. The Lord's timing is perfect. It still blows me away with such small details in my life. I was able to go away the first weekend in May with my mom and sister for a long girls weekend before my sister gets married. It was right after these crazy 6 weeks and perfect timing with my husband work. I couldn't have picked a better weekend. We almost went over Memorial Day weekend but nothing was working out. I can only point to the Lord for hand picking the weekend that I needed. Thank you Lord for your faithfulness!

I became an [ambassador](http://indeedandintruth.com/noonday-ambassador/) a few months ago and I'm so excited about sharing the artisan stories with y'all.\n\nThis giveaway snuck up on me and I had so much that I wanted to say. The artisans stories encourage me to be bold and share. Today we are celebrating our youngest 3rd birthday. I think of the women as they are holding thier babies and are able to provide for them through the work of Noonday. We all have the same dreams for our kids. The group that has a special place in my heart is from Ethiopia. They are women who many of them have been isolated from their families because they have HIV. I want to share [Tigiest's](http://vimeo.com/89689291#t=0s) story with you. I hope you watch and hear her words about how Noonday has helped her provide for her children. \n\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/89689291?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=34495e\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\nSo, what better way to celebrate women keeping their children with them than a fun giveaway! \n\nThe new Fall line is [here](http://elizabethmyer.noondaycollection.com/)!

The giveaway will end next Monday night, September 1st and I will announce the winner on September 2nd. \n\nI hope you find encouragement from the stories and share about the impact that our purchases can have.\n\nAs women I hope we will stand up with other women and make our voices heard that we do have power in our purchase!
